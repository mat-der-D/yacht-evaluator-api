## Overview

Yacht is a dice game where players use five dice to create specific combinations and compete for points. This document describes the rules for the version featured in "World Game Encyclopedia 51".

## Game Flow

### Basic Rules

- Players take turns in order
- Each player completes 12 turns to finish the game
- Fill in all 12 categories one at a time
- The player with the highest total score wins

### One Turn Flow

2. **Select Dice**: Choose which dice to keep and re-roll the rest (optional)
3. **Re-roll Again**: Further re-rolls are possible (optional)
   - Maximum of 3 rolls total
   - Maximum of 2 re-rolls (3 rolls including the initial roll)
4. **Select Category**: Choose one category from the dice result to record your score
   - Each category can only be used once
   - You must fill a category even if the score is 0 points

## Categories and Scoring

### Number Categories (1-6)

Points are awarded based on how many dice show each number.

| Category | Condition | Score Calculation |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Ace | Count of 1s | Number of 1s × 1 point |
| Deuce | Count of 2s | Number of 2s × 2 points |
| Trey | Count of 3s | Number of 3s × 3 points |
| Four | Count of 4s | Number of 4s × 4 points |
| Five | Count of 5s | Number of 5s × 5 points |
| Six | Count of 6s | Number of 6s × 6 points |

**Bonus**: If the total score for Ace through Six is 63 points or more, you earn a 35-point bonus.

**Example**: If the dice show [5, 5, 5, 2, 3]
- Choosing Five: 5 × 3 = 15 points

### Special Categories

| Category | Condition | Score |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Choice** | Any result | Sum of all five dice |
| **Four of a Kind** | Four or more of the same value | Sum of all five dice |
| **Full House** | Three of one value + two of another | Sum of all five dice |
| **S. Straight** | Four consecutive values | 15 points (fixed) |
| **B. Straight** | Five consecutive values | 30 points (fixed) |
| **Yacht** | All five dice the same value | 50 points (fixed) |

### Category Details

#### Choice
- Can be chosen with any dice result
- Score equals the sum of all five dice

**Example**: [6, 6, 5, 4, 3] → 24 points

#### Four of a Kind
- At least four dice showing the same value
- If condition is met: Score equals the sum of all five dice
- If condition is not met: 0 points

**Example**: [4, 4, 4, 4, 2] → 18 points

#### Full House
- Three dice of one value + two dice of another value
- If condition is met: Score equals the sum of all five dice
- If condition is not met: 0 points
- **Note**: Five of a kind also satisfies this condition and scores the sum of all dice

**Example**: [3, 3, 3, 5, 5] → 19 points
**Example**: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] → 15 points (five of a kind is valid)

#### S. Straight (Small Straight)
- Four consecutive values
- [1,2,3,4] or [2,3,4,5] or [3,4,5,6]
- If condition is met: 15 points (fixed)

**Example**: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4] → 50 points

## Strategy Tips

### Basic Strategy

1. **Balance the Upper Section (Ace-Six)**
   - Prioritize larger numbers (Four, Five, Six) early in the game
   - Save smaller numbers (Ace, Deuce, Trey) for later if needed

2. **Aim for High-Scoring Categories**
   - Yacht (50 points) and B. Straight (30 points) are very valuable
   - Full House and Four of a Kind are also good and achievable

3. **Using Choice**
   - Save it as insurance in case other categories fail
   - Or use it when you can score reliably high points

4. **Re-roll Strategy**
   - If the first roll is good, don't force re-rolls
   - Consider remaining re-rolls and risk when deciding whether to try again

### Advanced Strategy

1. **Expected Value Calculation**
   - Calculate expected value from current dice and remaining re-rolls
   - Compare certain points against expected value and decide accordingly

2. **Category Filling Strategy**
   - Avoid chasing only high-scoring categories early, or you'll face 0-point fills later
   - Fill categories in a balanced manner

3. **Watch Your Opponent**
   - Monitor opponent scores
   - Calculate backward from a winning score to determine what you need
